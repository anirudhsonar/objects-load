# objects-load
objects-load-scripts
This is just dirty script to generate moderate load on objects cluster. If you need any help, plz contact me @ anirudh.sonar@nutanix.com

Its not at all optimized code. And you may find lot of dirty hacks or badly written code. I usually practice the logic before I make any changes to actual automation. And this script is sort of dumpyard for all my practice code, evetually I found out, it can generate some good load so I started using it. In case you plan to use this script, then dont expect code is structured or follows any guidelines or best practices, so dont sweat much if something is not working, just ping me on slack, I will fix it.

NOTE : This script is not meant for perf measurement. Its not optimized to give you correct numbers.It can generate some moderate load and thats the purpose of this script.
